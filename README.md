# CS121 Code Examples

This repository contains code examples for the concepts introduced in
CS 121.  Each module has its own example folder.

For examples that use local files as inputs/output, such as in Module 5,
you may need to compile and run code from the console or open only the
individual module directory so paths will not be an issue.

The focus of each module is as follows:

* Module 1: Basic programming, setting up a project
* Module 2: Data and Expressions
* Module 3: Using Classes and Objects
* Module 4: Conditionals and Loops
* Module 5: Writing Methods, Using ArrayLists, Reading Files, Handling Exceptions
* Module 6: Writing Classes
* Module 7: Arrays, including Command Line Arguments
* Module 8: GUIs
